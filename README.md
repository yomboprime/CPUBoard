A carrier board for the FriendlyArm NanoPi-Duo SBC and the NanoPi-Duo 2

This is a carrier board for the [FriendlyArm NanoPi-Duo SBC](https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=69&product_id=197) and the [NanoPi Duo 2](https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=69&product_id=244)

I used the jack audio connector from [Sparkfun Eagle Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries) (included without modifications). It is licensed CC BY SA 4.0.
